This error typically occurs when you're using Expo's `start` command and there's a problem with your project's setup or dependencies.  The message itself isn't very specific, making debugging challenging.  It often points to an underlying issue rather than the error itself. For example, it might show up if your `package.json` is incorrectly configured, or if you have conflicting dependencies or missing native modules.
