# Expo CLI: Unexpected Error

This repository demonstrates a common but frustrating issue with the Expo CLI: encountering an "Unexpected Error" with no further details. This makes debugging extremely difficult.

The `expoBug.js` file contains a problematic setup (or a placeholder for one, since the actual cause varies).  The `expoBugSolution.js` file shows potential solutions and debugging steps.

**How to Reproduce (may vary depending on your project):**

1. Set up an Expo project (using `expo init`).
2. Introduce a problematic configuration in your `package.json` (see `expoBug.js` for example issues).
3. Run `expo start`. Observe the vague "Unexpected Error" message.
4. Attempt solutions from `expoBugSolution.js` to resolve the issue.

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

* **Dependency Conflicts:** Check your `package.json` for conflicting dependency versions. Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to resolve conflicting dependencies.
* **Incorrect Package.json Configuration:** Ensure your `package.json` is correctly formatted.  Missing or incorrectly placed fields can cause problems.
* **Missing Native Modules:** Make sure all necessary native modules are properly installed and linked. 
* **Corrupted Node Modules:** Try deleting your `node_modules` folder and reinstalling packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
* **Expo SDK Version Mismatch:** Check that the Expo SDK version in your `app.json` and the Expo CLI version are compatible.
* **Operating System Issues:** This error can sometimes be related to inconsistencies in your environment or your operating system.
