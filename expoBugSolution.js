The solution often involves methodical debugging to pinpoint the root cause.  Here are steps to take:

1. **Examine the Expo CLI Output:** Although the main error message is vague, carefully review *all* output from the Expo CLI. Sometimes subtle hints preceding the error are given.
2. **Check Your `package.json`:**  Ensure the file is valid JSON and there are no typos. Review dependencies for conflicts using `npm ls` or `yarn why`.
3. **Clean Your Project:** Delete your `node_modules` folder and reinstall using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. **Verify Expo SDK Version Compatibility:** Ensure your app.json's Expo SDK version matches or is compatible with your Expo CLI version.  Check the Expo documentation.
5. **Examine Log Files:** Check your operating system's logs for any more detailed error messages.
6. **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:** If you're unsure of the problem's origin, create a simple Expo project with only the necessary components to narrow down the issue.
7. **Search for Similar Issues:** Search for your specific error message or related errors in the Expo community forums or GitHub issues.  Someone else may have encountered a similar problem.
8. **Check your network connection.** If the unexpected error happens after you run `expo prebuild` , it may be caused by an unstable internet connection. You can try again when your internet connection is stable.
